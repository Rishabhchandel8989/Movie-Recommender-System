This is an Unsupervised Learning recommendation system, specifically a Content-Based Recommendation System using cosine similarity. Here's why:

1.)No Labeled Training Data:

The system doesn't use any labeled data or target variables
There's no training phase with correct answers
No user ratings or feedback are used to train the model

2.) Content-Based Approach:

Uses movie features like:
Overview
Genres
Keywords
Cast
Crew (Director)


3.)Key Unsupervised Components:
# Text vectorization
vectors = cv.fit_transform(new_df['tags']).toarray()

# Similarity calculation
similarity = cosine_similarity(vectors)
Uses CountVectorizer to convert text to vectors
Calculates similarity between movies without any supervised labels
Recommendations are made purely based on content similarity

4.)Recommendation Logic:

Movies are recommended based on similarity scores
No learning from user preferences or historical data
Purely based on content features similarity
